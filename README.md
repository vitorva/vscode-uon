## How to launch the project locally

First run :  
```bash
  npm install
```
Then open the project ans press `F5` to open a new window with your extension loaded.

## ANTLR grammar
If you change the [grammar file](src/grammar/UON.g4),
you need to re-generate the antlr files used by the extension by running :
```bash
  npm run antlr4ts
```

## Acknowledgement
The parser for UON have been implemented using [antlr4ts](https://github.com/tunnelvisionlabs/antlr4ts).

The autocompletion has been implemented with the excellent [c3 engine](https://github.com/mike-lischke/antlr4-c3).
