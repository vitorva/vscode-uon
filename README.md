## Acknowledgement
The grammar and the parser for UON for this library have been implemented using [Antlr4ts](https://github.com/tunnelvisionlabs/antlr4ts).

The autocompletion has been implement with the excellent [c3 engine](https://github.com/mike-lischke/antlr4-c3).

## How to launch the project locally

First run :  
```bash
  npm install
```
Then open the project from the root and run the extension locally by pressing <kbd>F5</kbd> or select <kbd>run</kbd> in the menu ant then <kbd>Start debugging</kbd>

## ANTLR grammar
If you change the [grammar file](src/grammar/UON.g4),
you need to re-generate the antlr files used by the extension by running :
```bash
  npm run antlr4ts
```
